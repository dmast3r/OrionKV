# OrionKV

OrionKV is a lightweight, disk-based key-value store inspired by the vast expanse of the cosmos and the Orion constellation. The project aims to serve as a rapid prototype exploring foundational database concepts, starting with an immutable append-only log and gradually evolving to incorporate more advanced features.

## Features (Initial Implementation)
- Immutable, append-only log.
- In-memory hash map for indexing.
- Periodic snapshotting of the in-memory hash map for crash recovery.

## Roadmap
- Transition to SSTables.
- Incorporation of LSM Trees.

## Usage
To be added.
